      "My journey into neurodivergent care began with a deeply personal challenge. When my younger son, Divyam, was first diagnosed, he was non-verbal. The early days of his therapy were filled with uncertainty, and I was told that he might never be able to speak. But as a mother, I held onto hope and remained committed to a path of relentless support. With determination and continuous effort, Divyam can now speak fluently in both Hindi and English. Today, he thrives as an independent teenager, and his progress from non-verbal to fluent stands as a powerful transformation—a journey from darkness to light, from uncertainty to hope, and from struggle to immense joy and achievement.",
      "This journey not only deepened my understanding of the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent children and their families, but it also ignited a profound desire to offer similar support to others. I am deeply aware of the resilience and dedication required by parents on this journey and strive to provide empathy and guidance to those navigating a similar path.",
      "Out of this vision, Divit Health was born. As Co-Founder, COO and CFO, my focus is on establishing Divit Health as a place of inspiration, support, and holistic care for neurodivergent children and their families. At Divit Health, we are committed to redefining healthcare for neurodivergent children through a comprehensive approach centered on each child's well-being and unique potential. Our goals include establishing a state-of-the-art Child Development Center (CDC) and a 'Residential school' for children with special needs, designed to provide a nurturing, inclusive environment where children can learn, grow, and develop independence.",
      "Through Divit Health, I am committed to fostering a supportive community where families feel empowered, and every child is given the opportunity to flourish. Together, we are building a foundation for a brighter, more inclusive future for neurodivergent children and their loved ones.",
